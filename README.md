This project is an experimental presentation about the paper named *Finite-time Complementary Filter-based Attitude Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Gyro Bias*.

*  The folder *Experimental_platform* is primarily an introduction to the experimental foundation. There are three PDF files *Control diagram*, *Framework*, and *PLATFORM_CHINESE* in this folder. The *Control diagram*  mainly introduces the framework of the control part of the paper.
